There are a couple of key differences between block-level elements and inline elements:

1.Content model:

  Generally, block-level elements may contain inline elements and (sometimes) other block-level elements.
  Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline elements.

2.Default formatting:

  By default, block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line.
  
  EXAMPLE :
  Block elements - <p>, <h1>-<h6>, list(<ul>, <ol>).
  Inline elements - <em>, <strong>, <a>.
